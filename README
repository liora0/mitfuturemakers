MIT Futuremakers Program - Reflections

WEEK ONE

07/06 - During this program, I hope to acquire a deeper understanding of how AI can be used to further advance various community initiatives and to address prominent societal issues.

07/07 - After attending David Kong's seminar of leadership and storytelling, I felt much more confident in my ability to tell stories and resonate with people through sharing stories. I realized that everyone really does have a story to share within them. The stories you tell to others can have an impact on those around you as well

07/08 - I thought that it was really interesting to learn more about the processes behind creating and runing ML Models. I also really enjoyed talking about inclusive leadership. I think that it's really important to create safe environmnemts that encourage inclusivity and support for one another. Good collaboration results in better work.

07/09 - TBD
